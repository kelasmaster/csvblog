## Current State of AI

- Natural Language Processing (ChatGPT, Bard)
- Computer Vision (Self-driving cars)
- Predictive Analytics (Healthcare diagnostics)

```python
# Simple neural network example
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
